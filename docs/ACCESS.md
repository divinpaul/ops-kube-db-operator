# Accessing the Instance

To verify access to the RDS Instance is configured correctly one can use a tool like [`pgweb`](https://github.com/sosedoff/pgweb) to get a web ui administration view of the database. You can use the script at [hack/access-db](hack/access-db) to access the db. Just run the script with the namespace and postgresdb crd name as arguments.
